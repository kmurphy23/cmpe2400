-- ica15
-- This ICA is comprised of 2 parts, but should be tackled as described by your instructor.
-- To ensure end-to-end running, you will have to complete the ica in pairs where possible :
--  q1A + q2A, then q1B + q2B
-- You will need to install a personal version of the ClassTrak database
-- The Full and Refresh scripts are on the Moodle site.
-- Once installed, you can run the refresh script to restore data that may be modified or 
--  deleted in the process of completing this ica.
